Thinking Through Project

"Implement a single page web application which utilizes a remote api and saves data between browsing sessions. 
The project is expected to utilize all of the major technologies covered in the course:
	Semantic HTML5			Done
	Advanced CSS			Done 
	JavaScript 				Done.
	Implement at least 3 views. Different views contain substantially different HTML and have different use cases for the use.
	Utilize a remote API for date retrieval.												Waiting on Stack to answer that one
	Allow users to create preferences and save the state between browser sessions.			No idea.
	Use a templating language/framework to avoid introducing XSS vulnerabilities.			No idea.
	Use a build system to package up your project and manage dependencies.					No idea.
	Style/theme your templates. CSS is required for this assignment. "						Done.
	
Thoughts: 
	Covering the first few should be easy. CSS and HTML covered anyway.
	Javascript will be interesting. Have to come up with somewhere to throw it in.
	  Could do the button thing again. See if I can't find some good code. At least on mobile view. Maybe.
	Three different views. Full screen, half-screen, and mobile are probably the best bets. 
	  Banner on the top like DA for half screen probably good bet.
	  Button good for the mobile. Put it right under the main/default view. Only shows one horoscope at any given time. Button drops button to pick another.
	  Full desktop... still not sure what to do there. Probably all the horosopes, the default on top. Otherwise, whichever is alphabetical.
	    (Probably follow template of the Soteria bubble things.)
	Remote API will just be for the horoscope data. Shouldn't be terrible.
	Preferences will just be the default, which is at top.
	XSS vulnerabilities? Have to read into that.
	Same for the build system.
	CSS should be easy. Almost handle itself after the bubble thing.
