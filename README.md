# CSC 590 - Spring 2016 - Major Project
# Horoscope Viewer

## Objective
Create a single web application for the user to view daily horoscope that can change to fit their preferred view and sign.

## Specifications
 * Uses [theastrologer]  (http://new.theastrologer.com/) as an API
 * The user has the choice of using a desktop web broswer to view the page, a mobile web browser, or an app to view their horoscope.
 * The user who views the page through a mobile browser will have the option to download the app for the future.
 * The site will save the user's personal sign, displaying this first by default, but can view any horoscope by selecting it in the additional bar/column.

## Installation Instructions
 * NodeJS is necessary for the scripts to run properly, as well as an active internet connection for the API.
 * All of the source files have to be downloaded into the same folder, including the images.
 * Opening the index.html file in a web browser, assuming the previous steps have been followed correctly, should result in the page running corrrectly.
